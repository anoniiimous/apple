It’s going to help grow MLS not only domestically, but internationally. You’ll have eyes all over watching our games,” said Kellyn Acosta, Los Angeles Football Club’s midfielder. “We talk about how we want the league to continue to grow and bridge the gap in comparison with other leagues, and I think having this Apple partnership is a step in the right direction. Leading into the World Cup in 2026, you want to build momentum and gain more exposure, and I think this partnership is going to truly be beautiful. I know my family is excited to have all the games in one place, and I think it’s going to be huge for the league and for the sport in the US.”</p><p>“It never really crossed my mind that a partnership like this would really alleviate a lot of those stresses for so many of our fans, our families, our friends, and for the players too, because we watch MLS all the time,” said Mark-Anthony Kaye, Toronto FC’s midfielder. “So it’s a good feeling to know that the league understands these issues and has done a really good job to put a deal together that can put us in a better position to bring MLS to the world.
